The project provides informational service on the SDG indicators **2.4.1 “Proportion of agricultural area under productive and sustainable agriculture”** and **15.3.1 “Proportion of land that is degraded over total land area”** based on the 10 m. agricultural land productivity and crop type mapping on Sentinel-2 data as well as Sen-4-CAP. This project created by Space Research Institute NASU-SSAU – the main scientific research organization on the remote sensing field in Ukraine, ERA-Planet programme member and Copernicus Academy member. The methodology for this pilot was developed within the ERA-Planet programme GEOEssential project. The workflows for data processing, crop type mapping and SDGs indicators assessment was developed and tested within Amazon GEO-Grant using Amazon computational resources. The project is compliant with European initiatives on the SDGs and Sendai Framework and the unique feature of the project is usage of moderate resolution Sentinel-1,2 and Landsat-8 mission images for land degradation assessment on the country and field levels. In addition, the project aims on the extent of the European technologies such as SEN-4-Cap, CREODIAS, GEOEsential workflows for territory of Ukraine and neighboring countries.

**Objectives**
- Assessment of land degradation and SDG indicators
- Support of UN Convention to Combat Desertification
- Extension of European technologies for Ukraine and neighboring countries
- Demonstrate methodologies implementable at national scale in support of ministries
